About Pixel Realm:
Pixel Realm is an independently developed gaming platform developed by
the Omega development team, based out of Pennsylvania in the US. With
Pixel Realm, you can enjoy a variety of different games and other
applications, all compressed into one neat window. Pixel Realm was
programmed mainly using the Python coding language. Pixel Realm was also
designed to provide an enjoyable gaming experience even on devices with
restricted settings, which will hopefully allow a greater array of
the population to enjoy peak gaming. Thank you - C L Maryniak and the
