Shoutout to Canva for being an absoulute life-saver when it comes to 
making custom images. It is seriously so underrated for making videos,
images, slideshows, etc. Very easy to use as well.

ChatGPT and GitHub copilot are both AIs that I use for programming help,
and they can be really clutch sometimes. They are both especially
helpful when it comes to coding and/or working in a terminal. GitHub 
copilot also has suggestions while you code that are so much more
helpful than you think. I don't own Github Copilot anymore but if you are
working on something big and need AI help with it, I recomend it.
