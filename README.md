# Pixel Realm

Pixel Realm is an independently developed gaming application. Pixel Realm contains parodies of real apps and games that are meant to be absolute jokes, but are still fun to play.

# Disclaimer

Pixel Realm is a terminal based application, which makes it difficult to use. I only reccomend using Pixel Realm if you are an experienced programmer, or have a friend that has programming knowledge.

# How to Use

1. Download and install the latest version of Python from the Python website (https://python.org).

2. Download Pixel Realm from this link ().

3. Open up your file explorer to the path you downloaded it to, and extract the zip file into a directory on your computer.

6. Open up your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac).
