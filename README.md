# Pixel Realm

Pixel Realm is an independently developed gaming application. Pixel Realm contains parodies of real apps and games that are meant to be absolute jokes, but are still fun to play.

# Disclaimer

Pixel Realm is a terminal based application, which makes it difficult to use. I only reccomend using Pixel Realm if you are an experienced programmer, or have a friend that has programming knowledge.

# How to Use

1. Download and install the latest version of Python from the Python website (https://python.org).

2. Open up your command prompt or terminal and run the following commands:
    - Windows: 
        - pip install pygame
        - pip install PyQt5
        - pip install PyQtWebEngine
    - Mac
        - pip3 install pygame
        - pip3 install PyQt5
        - pip3 install PyQtWebEngine

3. Download the source code for the latest version of Pixel Realm from this link (https://github.com/OmegaXK/Pixel-Realm/releases).

4. Open up your file explorer to the path you downloaded Pixel Realm to, and extract the zip file into a directory on your computer.

5. Open up the Pixel Realm folder that you just extracted, and navigate to the "src" directory.

6. Copy or memorize the path to the file called "startup.py".
    - Windows: right click the file and click "copy as pathname"
    - Mac: Right click the file, hold down the option key, and then select "copy startup.py as pathname"

7. Open up your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac).

8. Run the following command:
- Make sure to replace "/path/to/startup.py" with the actual path to startup.py from earlier.

    - Windows: python /path/to/startup.py
    - Mac: python3 /path/to/startup.py

9. Create an account and login to that account.
