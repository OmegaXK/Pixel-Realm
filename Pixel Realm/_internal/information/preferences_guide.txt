Pixel Realm Preferences Guide
Basically explains what each preference is and how to change it.

Open the "user_info" folder and navigate to "preferences.json". Open the 
file with your text editor (NotePad for windows, TextEDIT for Mac.)

Keep in mind:
! Modify only the values on the right-hand side of the file.
! Make sure all of the values are in quotation marks.
! Make sure to save your changes with control-s (command-s on mac).
! If you make a mistake when modifying the file, reset Pixel Realm and 
it should fix the error.

1. Audio 
You can set this setting to be either True or False. If False, no audio 
will play on Pixel Realm. If True, you will be able to hear the audio 
like normal.

2. FPS 
Don't change the FPS unless you have a really bad computer that can't 
run the games on 60 FPS. In that case, change the FPS to something
smaller (I. E. 45).

3. Use Name 
If True, the Crack Chat app will use your username in it's responses. If 
False, Crack Chat will not refer to you by your username.

4. Background Music 
If False, no background music will play. If True, a relaxing background 
song will play while you are running Pixel Realm.

5. PR Background 
If True, Pixel Realm will have the regular background. If False, Pixel 
Realm will have a simple gray background. If the regular background is
too bright or distracting, it is probably a good idea to turn it off.

6. More Apps Background 
This is the color of the background of the More Apps window. You can
choose from the following colors: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, 
Purple, Gray. The default is Gray.
